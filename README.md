# Stock-Analysis


## Overview of Project

Two year perfomance data (years 2017-2018) was analyzed for twelve stocks to evaluate potential investment strategy.  VBA code was utilized to calculate trading volume and returns on an annualized basis for each year.   

Susuquent coding exercise focused on refactoring VBA code to loop through the dataset one time as opposed to looping through each individual stock.

## Results

Original VBA Code (green_stocks_final.xlsm): This code calculates annualized volume and returns and creates output for each stock individually.  Code time measured at approximately 1.5 seconds for each year.

Refactored VBA Code (VBA_Challenge.xlsm) : Code refactored to calculate volume and returns for all stocks in one loop and susequently sent to output.  Code time measured at less than 0.35 seconds for each year.

Stock performance for 2017 and 2018 (both codes yield same results) given below:






Elapsed run time for the refactored code for 2017 and 2018 given below:





## Summary

In a summary statement, address the following questions:
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
